## Search Engine Example
- This is a simple example that showcases a search engine interface I developed using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for products in a predefined list and dynamically display results based on the search query.
- I'm sharing this search engine so you can use it as a starting point and take it to the next level according to your project's needs.
-  ❗ For production-ready applications, consider implementing backend technologies to handle data storage and business logic.
For the final version, I used Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

### Features:
> Search Bar: Users can input text to search for specific products.
> - Dynamic Product Display: Products are displayed in a grid layout that adjusts based on screen size.
> - Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive and mobile-friendly design.
- Technologies Used:
> HTML: Structure of the web page.
> JavaScript: Logic for filtering and displaying products based on user input.
> Tailwind CSS: Provides utility-first CSS classes for styling.
> Font Awesome: Icon library for visual elements.
